# Emerging Exceptions

## Developer Environment Setup

We are using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management, to install:
```shell
pip install poetry
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
poetry install
```

and then to use the virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```shell
poetry shell

# And to exit
exit
```
